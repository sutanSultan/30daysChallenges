Q1: What does AI-Driven Development mean to me?

AI-Driven Development makes me feel less like a traditional coder and more like an architect who designs, guides, and supervises AI systems. With tools like Gemini CLI, Claude Code, and Qwen, my role is no longer only writing every line of code and fixing endless errors. Instead, I focus on planning, problem-solving, and shaping ideas into real projects.
This shift allows me to build complex applications and AI agents that would normally take multiple developers. AI handles the heavy coding work while I focus on clarity, structure, and direction.

Q2: The future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development

I see it becoming a true teamwork model. Humans will bring vision, creativity, and quality control by defining what to build and why it matters. AI will handle the execution side, producing code rapidly and improving it through evaluation and feedback.
This combination means even a single developer can achieve what used to require a whole team. It opens the door for individual creators to build bigger products, ship faster, and create real value in the industry.
